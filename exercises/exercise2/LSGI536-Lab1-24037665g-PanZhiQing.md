## 1. For radiometric correction:
Create a graph of the Spectral Radiance for these features. Write down approximately 10-pixel values for each type of feature.

|\| Band 1 0.5-0.59 | Band 2 0.61-0.68 | Band 3 0.79-0.89 |
|---|---|---|---|
|Vegetation| - | - | - |
|Soil| - | - | - |
|Water| - | - | - |
|Urban| - | - | - |

- In EXCEL or on graph paper create a curve for each feature (you will only have 3 points on each curve as SPOT is not a hyperspectral sensor).
- Get the Max, Min, Mean and SD values for each box in the above table.
