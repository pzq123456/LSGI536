### 1. For radiometric correction:
Create a graph of the Spectral Radiance for these features. Write down approximately 10-pixel values for each type of feature.

|\| Band 1 0.5-0.59 | Band 2 0.61-0.68 | Band 3 0.79-0.89 |
|---|---|---|---|
|Vegetation| - | - | - |
|Soil| - | - | - |
|Water| - | - | - |
|Urban| - | - | - |

- In EXCEL or on graph paper create a curve for each feature (you will only have 3 points on each curve as SPOT is not a hyperspectral sensor).
- Get the Max, Min, Mean and SD values for each box in the above table.
INPUT1/(1.43194*POW(1.3,2))

#### Vegetation

#### Soil

#### Water

#### Urban

### 2. For contrast enhancement:
- Use contrast enhancement to highlight the water quality and conditions around Hong Kong and Lamma islands on a 3-band SPOT image 

â€“ you can use the whole image or zoom in on a smaller area for your exercise. Use either a Default Transform supplied on the Transform menu OR create a user transform by dragging the transform line, according to the spectral characteristics of water in each band.


Hand in: 

- Write a paragraph to describe which features in the ocean areas the enhancement allows you to interpret. Illustrate this by including an enhanced image in the document. 
- Write the other paragraph for each band to describe the stretch used and explain how it works to improve the interpretability of water. 

- Insert the relevant Transform Histogram into the document. Reference to the graph of Coincident Spectral Plots may also help.
