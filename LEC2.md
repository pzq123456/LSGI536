# Remote Sensing Fundamentals: Platforms, Sensors, and Image Characteristics
## Multispectral Scanners
The system that can collect data in many spectral bands and over a wider range of EM spectrum is called multispectral scanner. Multispectral scanners are either Across-track (whisk broom) or Along-track (push broom)

## Satellite Orbit

1. Satellite Orbit 90mins -120mins - 6 hours - 24 hours 
    1. Geostationary orbit 地球同步轨道 轨道高度固定
        - Period of rotation equal to that of Earth (24 hours) so the satellite always stays over the same location on Earth.
    2. Polar orbit 
    3. Sun-synchronous orbit 观测时间固定 总是在一天的同一时间观测某地
    - Cover each area of the world at a constant local time of day called local sun time.

2. Swath Width
   - The satellite’s orbit and the rotation of the Earth work together to allow complete coverage of the Earth’s surface, after it has completed one complete cycle of orbits.
   - As a satellite revolves around the Earth, the sensor “sees” a certain portion of the Earth’s surface. The area imaged on the surface, is referred to as the swath.
   - Landsat 8 : 16 天覆盖地球表面

3. Repeat Cycle : 
   - The time interval in which nadir point of the satellite passes over the same point on the Earth’s surface for a second time (when the satellite retraces its path) is called the repeat cycle of the satellite.

4. Revisit Time:
   - The satellite revisit time is the time elapsed between observations of the same point on earth by a satellite.

5. FOV and IFOV and signal-to-noise ratio 
large IFOV - large signal-to-noise ratio 需要牺牲了空间分辨率以提升接收到的信号能量

## Landsat
- The combined Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 revisit time for data collection with be every 8 days.

## Characteristics of Remote Sensing Images
1. Color allocation for Color composite images
   - True Color – 3 bands 真彩色
   - False Color – 3 bands 假彩色
   - Pseudo Color – single band 伪彩色
2. Image Resolutions
   - Spatial resolution
   - Temporal resolution
3. Radiometric resolution 辐射分辨率 : The ability of the sensor to differentiate very slight variations in brightness/energy.
4. Trade offs between image resolutions: It is very difficult to obtain extremely high spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution at the same time.
